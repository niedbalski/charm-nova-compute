  use-internal-endpoints:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |

      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.

      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  cpu-mode:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Set to 'host-model' to clone the host CPU feature flags; to
      'host-passthrough' to use the host CPU model exactly; to 'custom' to
      use a named CPU model; to 'none' to not set any CPU model. If
      virt_type='kvm|qemu', it will default to 'host-model', otherwise it will
      default to 'none'.  Defaults to 'host-passthrough' for ppc64el, ppc64le
      if no value is set.
  cpu-model:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Set to a named libvirt CPU model (see names listed in
      /usr/share/libvirt/cpu_map.xml). Only has effect if cpu_mode='custom' and
      virt_type='kvm|qemu'.
  # Storage configuration options
  libvirt-image-backend:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Tell Nova which libvirt image backend to use. Supported backends are rbd,
      lvm and qcow2. If no backend is specified, the Nova default (qcow2) is
      used. Note that rbd imagebackend is only supported with >= Juno.
  rbd-pool:
    type: string
    default: 'nova'
    description: |
      RBD pool to use with Nova libvirt RBDImageBackend. Only required when you
      have libvirt-image-backend set to 'rbd'.
  rbd-client-cache:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Enable/disable rbd client cache. Leaving this value unset will result in
      default Ceph rbd client settings being used (rbd cache is enabled by
      default for Ceph >= Giant). Supported values here are "enabled" or
      "disabled".
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores withing the nova rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the nova
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  ceph-pool-weight:
    type: int
    default: 30
    description: |
      Defines a relative weighting of the pool as a percentage of the total
      amount of data in the Ceph cluster. This effectively weights the number
      of placement groups for the pool created to be appropriately portioned
      to the amount of data expected. For example, if the ephemeral volumes
      for the OpenStack compute instances are expected to take up 20% of the
      overall configuration then this value would be specified as 20. Note -
      it is important to choose an appropriate value for the pool weight as
      this directly affects the number of placement groups which will be
      created for the pool. The number of placement groups for a pool can
      only be increased, never decreased - so it is important to identify the
      percent of data that will likely reside in the pool.
  restrict-ceph-pools:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Optionally restrict Ceph key permissions to access pools as required.
  # Other configuration options

      '{ kernel.pid_max : 4194303 }'
  # Huge page configuration - off by default
  hugepages:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The pecentage of system memory to use for hugepages eg '10%' or the total
      number of 2M hugepages - eg "1024".
      For a systemd system (wily and later) the prefered approach is to enable
      hugepages via kernel parameters set in MAAS and systemd will mount them
      automatically.
  ksm:
    type: string
    default: "AUTO"
    description: |
      Set to 1 to enable KSM, 0 to disable KSM, and AUTO to use default settings.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  os-internal-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Internal network (e.g.
      192.168.0.0/24)

      This network will be used to bind vncproxy client.
  harden:
    default:
    type: string
    description: |
      Apply system hardening. Supports a space-delimited list of modules
      to run. Supported modules currently include os, ssh, apache and mysql.
  aa-profile-mode:
    type: string
    default: 'disable'
    description: |

  default-availability-zone:
    type: string
    default: 'nova'
    description: |
      Default compute node availability zone.
      .
      This option determines the availability zone to be used when it is not
      specified in the VM creation request. If this option is not set, the
      default availability zone 'nova' is used.
      .
      NOTE: Availability zones must be created manually using the
      'openstack aggregate create' command.
      .
  resume-guests-state-on-host-boot:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
